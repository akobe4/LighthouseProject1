# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
To gain a better understanding of SQL and to be able to manipulate and query in different ways.  


## Process
- created a query to set-up the table in postgres, then a query to add the data to the file
- cleaned the data, removing data not relevant for project and divided prices by 1,000,000
- 
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
- not completely understanding the data set when I first started to clean and query data. This casued me needing to re-upload the data multiple times as data important to the questions asked has been deleted 
- ummmm 

## Future Goals
With more time I would understand the data set better, look for outliers, ensure all data types chosen for importing the data were correct once the data went it. A better overall understanding of the data going in would produce better data coming out.
