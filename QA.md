What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

A risk area is that data is constantly coming into the database as time goes on, there are new views to the web page/more purchases are made. So we want to ensure that the data is updated in regular intervals, that these intervals are set. We also want to know that there are no issues with the incoming data. 





QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

Implement a upload date column of data, so that it is known when the new data is added to the database. With this information we can confirm data accuracy by performing different queries to make sure the data is as we are expecting. Some examples of what we could be looking for in the queries are counts and averages to compare against the data we already have. If these are not what we're expeccting it would be a good indication to look more deeply into the data.
